        "This project brings Minesweeper to the TI-84 graphing calculator!",
        "Building Minesweeper in an embedded environment required a mix technical and artistic skills.",
        "The game was written entirely in embedded C with the help of a few open-source libraries.",
        "All sprites and graphics were drawn by hand.",
        "",
        "Typical of many embedded systems, the TI-84 has a slower processing speed than most large computers.",
        "This raised challenges as a video game must be responsive and fast-running to play.",
        "Design strategies which are suitable for a desktop video game may be far too slow when executed on the TI-84.",
        "So, to maintain an enjoyable gameplay experience, TI Minesweeper employs some clever tricks.",
        "",
        "Most notably, partial rendering was used to ensure a fast frame rate.",
        "The TI-84 is far too slow to redraw the entire screen every frame.",
        "To solve this problem, TI-Minesweeper always knows the state of the visible UI.",
        "A UI component is only redrawn when its actual state differs from that which is displayed.",
        "Thus, only small pieces of the screen are drawn to each frame.",
        "The gameplay remains smooth on a machine thousands of times slower than the average laptop!"
